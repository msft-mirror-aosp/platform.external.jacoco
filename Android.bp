// Some Jacoco source files depend on classes that do not exist in Android. While these classes are
// not executed at runtime (because we use offline instrumentation), they will cause issues when
// compiling them with ART during dex pre-opting. Therefore, it would prevent from applying code
// coverage on classes in the bootclasspath (frameworks, services, ...) or system apps.
// Note: we still may need to update the source code to cut dependencies in mandatory jacoco classes.
